There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Social Local

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  The app provides a way for neighbors to get together and encourages neighbors to get to know each other. This is even more important during quarantine when social interaction is at a low and opportunities for interaction are limimted.
  Users begin by creating an account and profile page with basic information about themselves and are then presented with a location based list of nearby users (who have their profile set to public) to create their neighborhood network.
  The core functionality of the app is to provide a convenient way to schedule events for which anyone in their network can attend as well as a platform for communication in a reddit or facebook style post / comment / dm format.
  When creating an event certain details must be specified by default so that everyone is on the same page and feels comfortable attending, such as the policy on wearing masks, social distancing, seating arrangement, max attendees, indoors / outdoors, etc., as well as any other details the organizer would like to include.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  There are far more neighborhoods than there are communities despite every neighborhood being prime real estate for a community.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  The app provides a platform to express an interest in forming a local community and the means to organize events and gatherings as well as providing a hyper local social platform.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.


## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Simply create a profile providing as much or as little information as you like then join your area's group or create one if it doesn't exist yet. From there you can schedule events or communicate / share with your network.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  Previously, I knew nothing about the many people who live their lives only a stone's throw away from me, but now I do and it's great because they're all awesome people and I had no idea! Thanks Social Local!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Get to know your neighbors and discover your local community.
